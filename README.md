 # A rookies pre work study guide.

## Description

My motivation for making this prework study guide is to inform and help fellow rookies like my slef along their journey into the coding world. When you first start the path to coding your going to fill over whelmed and scared but thats ok! 

My main goal when bulding this site was trying to help pave a some what clearer path thru prework. The prework for a boot camp can be a winding and challege road. Once you go down this road you relize your not in kansas anymore and thats where this study guide will help you on the way.


The problems this prework study guide sloves are, helping with git commands and the understanding of termialogly with Html,css and java.


Here are some expamples of things i have learened in bootcamp:

One of the main and most crucial things that i learned was making sure where you are nesting flies at. 

Which can be a huge mistake when trying to push our pull your repositories our when you are trying to add assets flies to vs code.

Remembering  the basic git commands will help you on your journey  as well, trying to look up every git command can be a hassel. So having a good git command cheat sheet will go a long way.  



When i a started working with css i leraned that when a developer wants to style a element directly in the HTML file you will use inline CSS.

In java to declare a variable you use the var keyword and after you use the keyword you give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how you will reference the information stored in the variable in your code.

## Usage 
 The user of the prework study guide can review notes from the following sections, Html,CSS,GIT, and Java Script. 
 The HTML section of this study gudie you will learn that HTML is the universal markup language for the Web.  It can be assisted by technologies such as CSS. CSS stands for stands for Cascading style sheets, which  is the language we use to style an HTML document. 
 Then we move to the JavaScript section of the study guide. In the JavaScript section we cover the topic loops. loops can execute a block of code a number of times. Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false . And the final section we will cover is Git. In the git section we will cover the command git status. Git status Checks what branch we are currently on. which is very crucial when doing PR and merging a repo.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
