      <h2>HTML</h2> 

      <ul>    

        <li>HTML is the universal markup language for the Web.</li>
       
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>

        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

        <li>h1: Tag represents the heading.</li>
         
        <li><!DOCTYPE/li> This tag defines the document type and HTML version.

        <li>head:This tag represents the document's header which can keep other HTML tags like title,link etc.</li>

        <li>title:the title tag is used indside the head tag to mention the document title</li>

        <li>Body:This tag represents the document's body which keeps other HTML tags
          like h1,div, p etc.</li>

        <li>class: HTML elements can have one or more classes, separated by spaces. You can style elements using CSS by selecting them with their classes.</li>

        <li>id:An HTML element can have an id attribute to identify it. id elements should always be unique to that single element, and each element should never have more than one id.</li> 

        <li>href:Links tell the browser where to go using an href attribute, which stores a URL.</li>

        <li>Basic Formatting:You can easily format text to be bold, italic, or underlined using simple formatting tags.</li>

        <li>Comments:HTML comments are sometimes used in code to explain parts of the markup. They are similar to comments in other languages. Users do not see comments in their browser.</li>
     
        <li>Div:A block level container (or ‘division’ of the web page) for content with no semantic meaning.</li>

        <li>Horizontal rules:This tag creates a black line one pixel thick that runs the all the way across its container. It can be styled to look differently with CSS.</li>

        <li>Lists:HTML supports two kinds of lists: ordered lists and unordered lists. Within lists each individual list item has its own tag.</li>

        <li>Unordered Lists:Unordered lists are just lists whose items are denoted with bullet points.</li>

        <li>Ordered Lists:Ordered lists’ items are denoted with numbers.</li>

        <li>Tables:An element for displaying information in rows and columns. Supports headers and footers for labeling columns. Divides information into rows (denoted by the tr tag) which contain cells (denoted by the td tag).
        </li>
         
        </ul>

      <h2>CSS</h2>

          <ul>

           <li>CSS stands for Cascading style sheets</li>

           <li>Style sheets come in three types.</li>

           <li>Incline: style attributes are used inline with the HTML tags.</li>
           
           <li>Embedded (internal)-style information is in a style tag which is nested in the head tag of a single web page.</li>

           <li>Linked(external)- The style is in one .css file that is linked to multiple web pages. The link tag on the page is connected to the external file.</li>

           <li>Properties: Properties are defined within selectors by defining a property and a value. They are separated with a colon and delineated with a semi-colon.</li>

           <li>Padding: The padding is the spacing between the content and the border (edge of the element.).</li>

           <li>Margin: The margin is the space around the element. </li> 

           <li>font-family: The font-family property sets the font of an HTML element’s text.</li>

           <li>Selectors: Selectors are used in CSS to select the parts of the HTML that are being styled.</li>

           <li>Class name selectors: You can also select HTML elements by their Class name. Unlike ID selectors, Class selectors select all elements with a matching class.</li>

           <li>Element selectors: You are able to select HTML elements first by simply using the name of the element.</li>

           <li>ID selectors: ID selectors are used to select only a single item on a page. Like the term (“identification”) indicates, ID selectors will ONLY select the first element with a matching ID.</li>

           <li>Attribute selectors: HTML elements are also able to be selected by their attributes.</li>

           <li>Child selectors:You can also use multiple selectors to get the exact elements you want, by using parental nesting. By using the “greater-than” symbol (>), you can select only the direct children of an element, going down only one level.
          </li>

          <li>Universal selector:The universal selector (*) may be used to select all the elements in a particular range.</li>

          <li>Pseudo class selectors:Pseudo Selectors can be used to narrow down a selection with certain rules. </li>
